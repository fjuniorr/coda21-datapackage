### Where was the data collected?

- Provide a well known name for the area the data was collected in
- Provide a minimum bounding rectangle to describe the spatial extent if you have not implemented this using contraints
- If location data is included in the data, what is the coordinate reference system

### How was the data collected?

- Was the data crowd-sourced or derived?
- Which instruments were used to collect the data?
- What do missing values (e.g. "na") and “null” values (i.e. an empty cell) mean?  Is the data unknown, missing or not applicable?

## Known usage

Describe where the data is used in reports, analysis or visualisations.

## Preparation

Provide information that may assist the reader in determining if the data is fit for their purpose. E.g.

- what error corrections were performed
- what data transformations were performed? E.g.
  - data excluded because it's sensitive
  - data aggregation, de-identification or anonymisation to protect privacy
  - derived data - what formula was used?

Your data may be prepared by a community of volunteers. If relevant, provide instructions on how to run any preparation and processing scripts to generate the data.
